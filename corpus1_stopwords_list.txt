this
but
has
up
for
the
of
it

the
these

in
the
of
they
are
for
the
of
in
the
the
of
the
and
and
in
so
as
they
in
this
is
the
that
they
are
and
not
and
that
if
of
their
be
and
only
its
by
a
more
or
on
the
same
the
has
been
into
being
because
the
had
a
on
through
a
he
was
to
it
to
the
only
because
the
that
other
in
have
to
to

to
it
and
it
for
on
which
by
this
to
be
in
it
be
to
is
so
as
a
by
which
is
out
of
that
it
is
very
to
that
all
this
only
by
being
on
that
is
or
and
to
or
or
at
in
the
that
they
have
that
they
they
or
which
or
them
to
all
this
is
of
before
the
at
being
a
is
than
before
and
that
he
can
into
the
of
the
by
to
and
he
is
too
to
and
do
at
the
so
he
does
the
by
down
his
and
for
the
and
so
we
have
only
what
to
the
of
those
who
as
as
it
is
in
the
of
their
and
we
have
that
it
is
only
to
be

by
in
of
which
a
of
their
it
is
that
in
and
that
some
of
these
are
but
here
again
the
is
so
that
we
be
that
any
by
in
the
of
our
will
be
at
but
in
those
who
do
not
up
a
at
their
they
what
is
a
of
in
in
or
in
on
other
or
their
own
and
against
this
they
what
is
for
their
and
they
a
on
that
is
an
on
which
they
can
only
after
a
or
more
on
their
they
on
their
they
in
some
of
the
on
the
but
the
is
most
by
who
have
to
have
a
of
for
the
when
he
has
a
at
his

him
about
being
to
all
any
that
he
have
to
into
some
in
on
the
and
so
and
the
have
to
be
and
they
are
very
to
the
because
it
is
through
them
that
has
most
of
its
then
are
the
and
which
are
to
those
who
into

because
the
by
them
are

some
than
those

by
of

of
with
a
that
it
it
can
on
both

of
the
i
that
is
more
to
be

my
own
is
that
both
these
are
that
the

for
a
that
was

i
have
a
for

if
so
it
is
to
some
because
it
is
on

is
by
most

their
for
it
was
my
as

this
with
has
me
that
the

we
the

the

that
at
the

a
more

we
that

is
of
this
its
is
that
a
very
of
to
a
very
few
or
some
not
be
a
if
were
not
a

in
an
but
to
a
of
to
do
the

is
very
and
but
a
very
will
them
on
a
to
do
it
and
there
is
no
such
in
if
you
a
in

you
will
not
any
such

the
of
the
is
by
the
themselves
at
they
to
it
so
and
it
not
a

for
it
if
a

not
its
you
not
any

a
on

only
in

it
to
but
from
that
they
very
the
of

we
have
no

the
why
the

most
can
do
he
can
his

in
the
of
he
is
his
on
himself
his
on
the
of
and
to
the
the
is
too
to
a
of
with
the

a
of
to
do
but
to
a
a
of
only
do
they
the
in
the

they
have
only
not

him
that
he

is
the
of
most
to
their
that
they
for
some
to
for
a
a
few
do
so
but
in
the
the
of
and
the
of
with
the
the
of
the
having
been
by
the
and
by
the
he
on
the
so
after
the
itself
has
to
be
very
to
him
the
of
this
is
to
the
of
the
of
a
the
of
its
with
through
a
and
very
now
the
of
which
i
by
to
have
a
in
each
has
only
in
out
of
on
the
other
the
where
there
is
or
more
to
we
have
that
the
of
the
of
but
the
on
the
the
is
that
a
which
is
in
the
and
on
a
has
of
than
a
of
which
the
to
that
and
the
and
in
it
a
is
by
there
are
then
no
to
be
but
the
of
in
a
are
of
the
to
be
are
the
are
of
and
only
the
of
any
they
to
on
and
a
who
in
the
who
has
there
is
a
of
the
and
its
is
to
there
but
a
by
a
does
so
with
the
will
to
him
and
for
his
is
a
for
all
the
and
he
will
have
in
the

the
because
he
has
not
the

how
to
that
with
a
of

the
to
a
of
as
it
is
the
only
no
as
has
at
a
of
through
the

of
such
the
and
most
in
this
is
by
in
the
and
with
it
and
this
why
is
so
such
a
as
has
been
is
only
in
a
from
and
from
during
an
a
is
at
such
a
and
in
a
too
in
such
and
a
is
to
himself
and
to
himself
of
the
these
are
to
be
or
no
or
no
but
the
of
on
the
of
the
and
that
be
if
the
is
not
or
the
any
has
been
now
for
both
from
and
in
and
where
and
as
as
in
and
was
any
from
a
of
their
and
of
have
it
not
to
a
so
in
their
and
by
themselves
before
was
an
for
under
the
she
was
from
or
her
was
as
was
then
and
it
any
and
the
on
which
it
too
to
any
from
but
then
it
was
not
an

it
had
its
in
this
of
the
in
had
a
of

had
off
the
of

had
on
it
so
a
as
the

was
for
no
at
or
was
in
so
as
the
of
the
in
the
of
was
and
the
of
this
is
the
why
that
is
why
is
a
very
and
other
but
in
in
and
a
of
all
over
the

to
what
it
on
the
the

the
in

they
are
why
this
should
be

only
a
why
then
it

not
the

that
down
the

that
up
the
between
the
what
the
of

and
this
is
the
most
and
of
doing
but
it
is
not
the
only
if
it
be
a
if
he
be

not
they

not
they

a
very
of
an
for
a

if
he
down
the

to
it
this

this
for
the
most
other
to
that
or
it
the
is
at
all
there
is
not
in
to
all
the
in
some
from
the
of
as
as
the
is
a
who
have

the
they

they
can
them
very
for

the
have
more

that
its

it
the
so
as
to
a

a
the

only
that
the

that
of
very
some
of

the
that
the

then
the

no
it

the
is
that
any

the

they
more

so
from
its
being

there

that
there
is
a

such
is
to

the
most
the

the
they

in
so

a
in
that

to
be

the

after
they
have

this
the

for
on
more

the

in
the

to
have
a
be

it
on
after
such
a

as
has
been
than
was
before
that
but
in
this
the
will
not
have
it
will
have
to
some
to
a
the
the
of

the

the
in
the
some
into

that
that
other
those

so
on

can
be

some

the
the
is
that

for
the
most

more
they
very
they

if
that
is
so
the
of
which
they

what
is
to
their
they

for
it
what
they
they
had
any

in

have
a
which

the
of
at

and
this
is
the
to
that
is
as
has
been
before
a
very
a

them
to
all
the

from
that
a
the

have
been
more

they
were

for
this

now
the
only
this
has
it
for
the
of
to
a
than

than
they
to

a
and
a
are
but
i
do
not
the
of
is
of
this
all
the
of
the
are
not
of
it
the
same
to
whom
i
have
before
in
the
an
again
that
of
the
were
in
these
a
for
the
of
the
of
and
that
it
was
no
of
the
of
the
to
a
of
for
which
was
the
most
that
be
when
the
of
the
of
had
the
only
in
where
at
once
be
and
when
a
of
to
be
than
at
any
and
this
of
the
there
are
some
in
the
of
the
of
which
as
will
be
from
in
its
of
there
is
some
when
a
to
he
is
the
of
the
and
when
so
a
too
if
the
be
this
of
and
his
of
the
then
is
that
the
of
does
not
the
of
it
does
it
in
the
it
the
but
it
does
not
the
a
in
a
does
not
are
they
are
from
a
most
in
they
are
very
to
and
but
the
in
a
only
a
the
of
a
has
been
to
the
out
of
the
and
that
be
it
have
been
to
have
the
by
than
to
have
it
by
but
this
those
are
in
or
as
a
to
be
the
of
a
the
to
a
and
the
to
a
which
are
in

and
is
is
through
the
of
to
whom
those
are
and
who
those
in
all
his
this
is
because
as
has
so
been
there
is
now
no
in
the
of
the
the
who
has
been
that
it
was
for
the
to
from
to

no
now
be
if
the
were
to
of
its
as
i
have
about
a
as
the
of
to
at
which
the
should
but
he
does
not
he
a
as
the
below
which
the
in
the
should
be
or
as
a
about
which
the
being
or
at
in
a
i
to
that
of
its
is
at
by
no
an

the
it
is
not
a
a
and
i
what
to
me
for
that
the
by
a
at
a
its
own
be
and
the
be
to
but
as
has
been
the
of
is
to
our
not
only
to
a
against
a
of
but
to
that
when
that
of
the
of
the
or
are
then
to
that
for
their
own
if
they
all
other
of
to
their
own
will
and
in
as
to
the
of
this
is
it
is
that
the
of
can
in
a
that
it
can
if
it
will
other
and
that
if
it
it
can
and
while
all
it
on
most
both
in
the
of
the
and
out
of
it
have
that
such
was
their
and
we
at
once
this
is
or
for
it
is
to
to
the
of
the
of
during
before
we
what
the
of
the
in
a
is
the
of
this
in
its
most
that
in
a
the
of
can
its
at
any
that
it
has
it
to
more
that
the

further
that
it

so
its
further
but
in
this
the
if
the
has
once
there
are
in
a
no
of

again
with

very
to
those
who
have
it
will
not
it
at
they
are
of
other
in
its

at
such
the
of
is
as
for
the
of
as
for
any
the

this
if
the
to
the
of
the
can
not
as

is
on
with
if
you
to
that
you
will
you
can
in
from
some
of
but
in
a
there
is
no
to
be
had
who
has
it
to
it
and
will
not
with
it
what
has
been
to
can
not
be
they

so
is
a
it

but
if
it

it
will
in
no
its

be
more

if
any
or
at
such
the
on
it
there
is
a
and
is
the
then
to
be
below
the

this
is
as
as
to
that
it
very
to
that
if
it
very
some
it
down
to
that
and
the
that
is
there
is
no
to
the
of
the
no
and
no
will
it
to
and
we
can
not
that
they
should
is
an
by
and
with
those
the
of
at
any
is
a
of
only
to
be
other
of
it
can
only
be
by
and
and
in
the

but
can
what
of
will
a
on
such
a
there
is
no
of
at
a
just
by
the
and
at
each
how
it
is
of
in
such
a
the
to
be
is
that

of
are
too
only
a

but
too
a
be

and
it
to
its
it
was
in
those
and
the
of
this
is
the
more
because
the
is
not
the

on
the
in
when
the

the
of

it
is

and
it
so
to
it
that
will
be
when

that
will
be
so
when
in

has
been
so
a
the
of

it
an
not

to
what

the
only
of
this
the
in

the
and
this
more
as
the
is
to
be
and
is
if
to
by
a
the
it
when
the
is
and
no
very
that
all
the
of
the

such
a
does
from
the

from
all
the
than
have
been

it
does
not
the
the
an

the
i
what
once

and
just
how
we
it
you
will
that
the
which

some
of
them
as
as

as
very
after
the
the
of
the
of
which
only
in
from
a
can
both
of
these
in
some
in
this
we
were
out
a
as
we
are
under
and
more
but
the
on
all
that
had
been

as
a
he
a
of
that

and
a
to
the
this
was
a
very
and
most
in
the
of
the
because
there

was
that
we
had

other
of
that
be
up

there
a
through
a
the
about

there
is
a
very

the
that
to
the

too
to
so
we
have

should
his
how
the

that
then
were
about
which
about
in
our
we
if

so
what
to
the
that
